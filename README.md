# forecast-brentoilprice
**1. The dataset and main objective**

The dataset was retrieved from US Energy Information Administration, but it was downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mabusalah/brent-oil-prices) and containt price of oil from 1987 to 2021. The main goal of this project is to predict the oil price from this dataset.

**2. Test Harness**

Test harness mus be developed for investigate data and evaluate model. This involves two steps:
- Defining a validation test
After resampling dataset, we could get monthly price of oil, we obtain total number of dataset is 405 and then we split the dataset into validation and evaluation dataset with ratio 5:95.
- Developing a method for model evaluation
Evaluation dataset will be used for model evaluation. The strategy of model evaluation can be seen in flowchart below.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**4. Model Evaluation**

**5. Model Validation**
